Revision history for Perl extension TAP::Formatter::JUnit.

    - Add support for ALLOW_PASSING_TODOS environment variable
      Some CPAN modules have passing TODOS that are OK; we don't
      want these passing TODOS to be marked as errors. The 
      ALLOW_PASSING_TODOS environment variable (if set to a true value)
      will mark passing TODOs in a test suite as succeeding tests.

    - Hudson is insanely picky about "bad" (i.e., non-ASCII) characters in
      its XML input. Added code to defang most of these.
    - Ditto for entities - it only understands the most basic XML entities
      (&quot;, &apos;, &gt;, &lt;, &amp;), so escape the ampersands there too.

    - add timer output for each test case (not just for the suite as a whole);
      Hudson needs this in order to show timing output for test runs.  Thanks
      to Mark Aufflick for the poke.
    - internal cleanups

0.02    Fri Jan  9 23:35 PST 2009
    - POD updates
    - minor cleanup to the test names output in JUnit
    - attempt to fix failing CPAN Tester reports, where an older version of
      'prove' was being picked up by t/formatter.t; provide our own
      't/bin/my-prove' and use that instead.

    - initial version
    - had this sitting around on my HD for several months and am (finally)
      getting around to uploading it to CPAN
